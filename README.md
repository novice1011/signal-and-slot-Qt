# signal-and-slot-Qt
Experiment about signal and slot between different classes

This project is created to learn how to modify object (change the 'text' of a pushbutton).

ThereThere are 2 classes, MainWindow and Form

MainWindow class contain a pushButton, and a widget.
The widget is promoted to a new class. Form class.
Form class is a class with form (UI) generated by Qt.
Form class also contain a pushButton.

What I want to do here is click pushButton in MainWindow and modify the pushButton in Form
and click pushButton in Form and modify the pushButton in MainWindow

There are two ways to modify the pushButton in Form
1. use signal and slot
2. use function to access the pushButton which is a private object in Form class
